        <p align="center"><strong>how tall are you?</strong><br>

        <p align="center"><strong>how old are your kids?</strong><br>
          3 1/2 and 2 years old. i know, it's crazy</p><br>
        <p align="center"><strong>what do you do for fun?</strong><br>
          i like to read, play the piano, sing, hang with my kiddos, and give back to the community<br>
          anyway i can. if you search hard enough,you might find me on youtube. </p><br>
        <p align="center"><strong>what kind of camera and lenses do you use?</strong><br>
          nikon d700. i switch between 3 lenses: 50mm 1.4, 85mm 1.2, 24-70mm 2.8</p><br>
        <p align="center"><strong>who are some of your favorite photographers?</strong><br>
          yan palmer, tara whitney, natalie norton</p><br>
        <p align="center"><strong>what is your favorite programming language?</strong><br>
          as of right now, ruby, because it's the only one i know. but it's so easy to use<br>
          and easy to read, so my mind may never change.</p><br>
        <p align="center"><strong>how do you balance school and your kids?</strong><br>
          very carefully. jk. kids force you to take a break from school, which also gives my mind a break.
          but if you really want to know how to balance work/school/life, ask <em>rachel warbelow</em>.
          she is a teacher, plays the cello for the denver philharmonic symphony, volunteers to teach high schoool students how to program, is part of GDI,
          and founded a school in a different state than where she lives. baller status.<br>
          just remember "you have as many hours in a day as beyonce"</p>
